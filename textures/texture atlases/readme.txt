This folder contains texture atlases, which hold textures for objects that have been simplified to have less materials

Example:
The microwave has 3 different metal textures, which have the same shinyness, but 3 different colors
A texture atlas will store these 3 colors, thus reducing the material count from 3 to 1

This principle also applies to full details, like combining a tech display and grille texture into one png file

NOTE:
if you are modifying a texture atlas, you may have to change how it is used in your final application, as it may try to filter the texture, even though it is only a 2x2 texture.
Likely, if you are using the Unity Game engine, you will have to change texture filtering to "closest"
