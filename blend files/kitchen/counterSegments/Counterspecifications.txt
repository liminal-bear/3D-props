My personal "How to" in making a counter base segment in Blender

start with 1x1 cube in blender
extrude 0.1 up
extrude 0.1 out (from newest up face)
bevels are .03 with 3 segments
drawers have padding of 0.04 from edge of module
drawers are extruded 0.02 out

for drawer handles, import handle, scale by .05
move out by 1.06, align z and x as desired
